# Chat Ripple

### [üåçLIVE](https://chat-ripple.web.app/)

In creating this project, I used MERN stack technology. This is a messenger website. Our ultimate online destination for making new friends and fostering meaningful connections allows users to easily discover and connect with new friends from around the world in a safe and interactive environment. Also, users communicate with friends in real-time.

## Features:

- Login or register and connect with the Google authentication system.
- Users can discover new friends and send friend requests. They can also cancel friend requests.
- Users can see who has sent them a friend request. If they want, you can accept or delete their request.
- Users can view their friend list. And can chat with them in real-time.

## Technologies:

React JS - React Router - React Hook Form - Axios - React Emoji Picker - Firebase - React Query - Moment JS - Node JS - Express JS - MongoDB.
